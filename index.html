                <p>
                    The Cornell High Frequency Trading Club (HFTC) is dedicated to advancing 
                    the field of high-frequency trading through cutting-edge FPGA engineering. 
                    We bring together passionate engineers, traders, and researchers to explore 
                    the intersection of hardware acceleration and financial markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our club focuses on developing low-latency trading systems, optimizing 
                    algorithms for FPGA implementation, and pushing the boundaries of what's 
                    possible in high-frequency trading technology.
